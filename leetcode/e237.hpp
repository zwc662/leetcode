//  237. Delete Node in a Linked List
//  Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
//  Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.

        node->next = node->next->next;

};
